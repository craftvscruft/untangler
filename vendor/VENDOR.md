We are currently aiming to release Untangler under Apache v2.
Therefore, it should be fine to incorporate MIT and BSD licensed grammars.

Eclipse v1.0 is *probably* fine to appear alongside Apache content as long as its original terms are preserved, 
not appearing to be re-licensed - this could use some research. Do the terms of the grammar apply to the 
generated parser code?
